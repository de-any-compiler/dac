# Changelog

All notable changes to dac are recorded here. The format is loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), adapted for dac's
batch-based development model from [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md).

## Recording rules

- **One entry per finished batch.** When a batch from `PLAN.md` lands, its
  goal + deliverables + closed requirement IDs move here.
- **Group by milestone.** Inside a milestone, list batches in completion order.
- **Reference IDs.** Always include the batch ID (`B1.4`), and the
  FR/NFR/I numbers the batch closed, so the spec stays traceable.
- **Releases live at the top.** Tagged releases get a `## [x.y.z] — YYYY-MM-DD`
  heading above the in-progress section.
- **The "Unreleased" section is the live one.** Move entries out of it when
  cutting a release.

## Project bootstrap (2026-06-01)

- Imported the design notes / requirements spec
  (`dac_design_notes_requirements_spec.md`).
- Authored [README.md](./README.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md),
  [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md), [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md),
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md), this file.
- Locked in two foundational decisions:
  - **Rust** as the implementation language ([ADR-0002](./DECISIONS.md)).
  - **Custom SSA-based decompilation IR** ([ADR-0002](./DECISIONS.md)).
- No code yet; M0 batches are the first implementation work.
